## What is ImgCompress?

ImgCompress is a **self-hosted image processing server** that runs entirely inside a single Docker container. It handles compression, format conversion, and AI-powered background removal, all locally on your own hardware. No cloud APIs, no third-party uploads, no tracking.

Built for people, homelab enthusiasts, and anyone who values privacy and owns their data.

---

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **70+ Image Formats** | HEIC, HEIF, PSD, AVIF, EPS, PDF, WebP, TIFF, BMP, GIF, and 60+ more |
| **Local AI Background Removal** | Bundled model runs on your CPU. No API key, no subscription, no upload |
| **Bulk Compression** | Multi-core parallel processing across entire photo libraries |
| **Format Conversion** | HEIC to WebP, PSD to JPG, image batches to paginated PDF, and more |
| **Per-File Cropping** | Crop each upload before conversion with ratio presets (Free, 1:1, 16:9, 4:3) or custom pixel dimensions |
| **Web UI + CLI** | Browser dashboard for day-to-day use; CLI for scripting pipelines |
| **Single Container** | Every codec and library pre-bundled, zero host dependencies |
| **Air-Gap Ready** | Once pulled, runs fully offline. No internet required, ever |

---

## AI Background Removal: Local & Private

Stop uploading personal or client photos to cloud-based removers. ImgCompress ships a bundled AI model that runs background removal **on your own hardware**. No API call, no subscription, no file ever leaves your server.

| Original | Background Removed |
|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="images/image-remover-examples/landscape-with-sunset-yixing-original.avif" width="380" alt="Original sunset landscape photo"/> | <img src="images/image-remover-examples/landscape-with-sunset-yixing-ai-transparency.avif" width="380" alt="Same photo with background removed by local AI"/> |

---

## Quick Start

Pull the image, open `localhost:3001`, start converting. About 60 seconds total.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name imgcompress \
  -p 3001:5000 \
  karimz1/imgcompress:latest
```

For Docker Compose, environment variables, and deploying without the mascot, see the **[full installation guide](https://imgcompress.karimzouine.com/docs/installation)**.

## Why I Built ImgCompress

I was tired of the "software loop." Every time I needed something simple, I had to install another app:

- **PSD files**: Needed specialized software just to convert them to an image file.
- **HEIC files**: Needed another converter for regular photo files.
- **Image to PDF**: Needed another app just to share a screenshot for work, since a PDF is often better for emails and easy for others to print.
- **AI Backgrounds**: I realized I needed one more app for that too.

I thought to myself: "Why can't one tool just do it all?" Plus, uploading personal photos to random online converters never felt right to me.

### One Toolbox for Everything

So I built a single toolbox that can take over **70 different formats** and fix them all in one place. Whether you need to convert PSD or HEIC files to an image, turn a screenshot into a PDF for a work email, or shrink a massive 4K photo, this tool does it automatically.

The community has now pulled the image tens of thousands of times, which shows the pain is real.

### Why Docker?

I chose Docker because it keeps your computer clean. Instead of you having to install 70 different messy libraries on your system, I packed everything into one **Ready-to-go Box** that you can run anywhere called **imgcompress**. It just works.

---

## Privacy by Design

| | |
|---|---|
| **No cloud processing** | Conversions, compression, and AI inference all run locally. Images never leave your machine. |
| **No telemetry** | No analytics, no crash reporting, no feature flags phoning home. Completely silent on the network after startup. |
| **Offline after pull** | Once the image is pulled, no internet connection is ever needed again. No license checks, no expiry. |
| **Open source** | GPL-3.0. Audit the code, fork it, self-host it forever. |

---

## Security-Hardened Architecture

ImgCompress is built with a **Security-Hardened, Minimal Image** architecture, bringing de facto container security standards to your homelab or production environment.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Minimal Surface** | No shell (`bash`, `sh`), no network tools (`curl`, `wget`, etc.), no package manager. The attack surface is drastically reduced. |
| **Minimal Components** | System dependencies are aggressively pruned to maintain a minimal runtime environment. |
| **Non-root User** | Runs as a non-root user `nonroot` by default. |
| **DHI Base Images** | Using Docker Hardened Images from the official [DHI](https://www.docker.com/products/hardened-images/) project for build phases and runtime Image. |
| **SBOM and Provenance** | The Docker Image is built with a full Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and build provenance attestation. |
