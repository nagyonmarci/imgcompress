## What is ImgCompress?

ImgCompress is a **self-hosted image processing server** that runs entirely inside a single Docker container. It handles compression, format conversion, and AI-powered background removal, all locally on your own hardware. No cloud APIs, no third-party uploads, no tracking.

Built for people, homelab enthusiasts, and anyone who values privacy and owns their data.

---

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **70+ Image Formats** | HEIC, HEIF, PSD, AVIF, EPS, PDF, WebP, TIFF, BMP, GIF, and 60+ more |
| **Local AI Background Removal** | Bundled model runs on your CPU. No API key, no subscription, no upload |
| **Bulk Compression** | Multi-core parallel processing across entire photo libraries |
| **Format Conversion** | HEIC to WebP, PSD to JPG, image batches to paginated PDF, and more |
| **Per-File Cropping** | Crop each upload before conversion with ratio presets (Free, 1:1, 16:9, 4:3) or custom pixel dimensions |
| **Web UI + CLI** | Browser dashboard for day-to-day use; CLI for scripting pipelines |
| **Single Container** | Every codec and library pre-bundled, zero host dependencies |
| **Air-Gap Ready** | Once pulled, runs fully offline. No internet required, ever |

---

## AI Background Removal: Local & Private

Stop uploading personal or client photos to cloud-based removers. ImgCompress ships a bundled AI model that runs background removal **on your own hardware**. No API call, no subscription, no file ever leaves your server.

| Original | Background Removed |
|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="images/image-remover-examples/landscape-with-sunset-yixing-original.avif" width="380" alt="Original sunset landscape photo"/> | <img src="images/image-remover-examples/landscape-with-sunset-yixing-ai-transparency.avif" width="380" alt="Same photo with background removed by local AI"/> |

---

## Per-File Cropping (since v0.7.0)

Every upload gets its own crop overlay before conversion. Pick a ratio preset (Free, 1:1, 16:9, 4:3) or type exact pixel width and height. Selections are saved per file, so one batch can mix square thumbnails with 16:9 covers without re-uploading.

<img src="images/web-ui/web-ui-crop-feature.webp" alt="ImgCompress crop overlay with aspect-ratio presets, zoom slider, pixel dimensions, and keyboard shortcuts" width="100%" />

### How to use it

1. Drop your images into the upload area as usual.
2. On any file row, click the crop icon to open the editor.
3. Pick an aspect ratio preset (1:1, 4:3, 16:9, …) or set width and height manually.
4. Zoom and crop to frame the shot exactly the way you want it.
5. Click **Save** to keep the crop, **Discard** to back out, or **Remove** to clear a previously saved crop.
6. Convert as normal. The crop is applied first, then your chosen format, quality, resize, and background-removal settings.

> [!NOTE]
> **Server-rendered formats:** Some formats (e.g. PSD, EPS) are rendered server-side into a crop-friendly bitmap so you can still crop them in the browser.

Full walkthrough and demo video: **[Image Crop Editor docs](https://imgcompress.karimzouine.com/docs/web-ui#image-crop-editor)**.

---

## Quick Start

Pull the image, open `localhost:3001`, start converting. About 60 seconds total.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name imgcompress \
  -p 3001:5000 \
  karimz1/imgcompress:latest
```

For Docker Compose, environment variables, and deploying without the mascot, see the **[full installation guide](https://imgcompress.karimzouine.com/docs/installation)**.

## Why I Built ImgCompress

I was tired of the "software loop." Every time I needed something simple, I had to install another app:

- **PSD files**: Needed specialized software just to convert them to an image file.
- **HEIC files**: Needed another converter for regular photo files.
- **Image to PDF**: Needed another app just to share a screenshot for work, since a PDF is often better for emails and easy for others to print.
- **AI Backgrounds**: I realized I needed one more app for that too.

I thought to myself: "Why can't one tool just do it all?" Plus, uploading personal photos to random online converters never felt right to me.

### One Toolbox for Everything

So I built a single toolbox that can take over **70 different formats** and fix them all in one place. Whether you need to convert PSD or HEIC files to an image, turn a screenshot into a PDF for a work email, or shrink a massive 4K photo, this tool does it automatically.

The community has now pulled the image tens of thousands of times, which shows the pain is real.

### Why Docker?

I chose Docker because it keeps your computer clean. Instead of you having to install 70 different messy libraries on your system, I packed everything into one **Ready-to-go Box** that you can run anywhere called **imgcompress**. It just works.

---

## Privacy by Design

| | |
|---|---|
| **No cloud processing** | Conversions, compression, and AI inference all run locally. Images never leave your machine. |
| **No telemetry** | No analytics, no crash reporting, no feature flags phoning home. Completely silent on the network after startup. |
| **Offline after pull** | Once the image is pulled, no internet connection is ever needed again. No license checks, no expiry. |
| **Open source** | GPL-3.0. Audit the code, fork it, self-host it forever. |

---

## Security-Hardened Architecture

ImgCompress is built with a **Security-Hardened, Minimal Image** architecture, bringing de facto container security standards to your homelab or production environment.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Minimal Surface** | No shell (`bash`, `sh`), no network tools (`curl`, `wget`, etc.), no package manager. The attack surface is drastically reduced. |
| **Minimal Components** | System dependencies are aggressively pruned to maintain a minimal runtime environment. |
| **Non-root User** | Runs as a non-root user `nonroot` by default. |
| **DHI Base Images** | Using Docker Hardened Images from the official [DHI](https://www.docker.com/products/hardened-images/) project for build phases and runtime Image. |
| **SBOM and Provenance** | The Docker Image is built with a full Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and build provenance attestation. |
