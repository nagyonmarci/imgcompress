## v0.8.2 — 2026-06-04

- UI: Replaced emoji language flags with cross-platform [`flag-icons`](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons) so flag rendering is consistent across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Reported via email by Armin. [#669](https://github.com/karimz1/imgcompress/issues/669)
- Docker: Bootstrapped a local `docker-container` buildx builder via `scripts/ensureBuildxBuilder.sh` and threaded `--builder` through the Makefile and dev scripts, so builds no longer require Docker Cloud or hit Cloud Build quotas. [#670](https://github.com/karimz1/imgcompress/issues/670)
- Security: Bumped DHI base image digests (Debian 13.4 → 13.5), `uv` 0.11.11 → 0.11.18, and 6 runtime Python packages (`pycparser`, `pillow_heif`, `psd-tools`, `rembg`, `onnxruntime`, `fpdf2`). Trivy now reports 0 vulnerabilities, down from 1 HIGH (libcap2 CVE-2026-4878). [#671](https://github.com/karimz1/imgcompress/issues/671)
- Docs: Added a dedicated Per-File Cropping section to the README with walkthrough, screenshot, and YouTube demo link.

## v0.8.1 — 2026-05-30

This patch release addresses a dependency oversight from [v0.8.0](https://github.com/karimz1/imgcompress/releases/tag/release_0.8.0), forgot to update the ``release-notes.md`` which triggers ``Update available`` even on the latest version.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed incorrect version display causing false "Update Available" notification — see [#668](https://github.com/karimz1/imgcompress/issues/668)

## v0.8.0 — 2026-05-30

- Feature: Added multi-language support to the imgcompress web UI.
  Special thanks to [nagyonmarci](https://github.com/nagyonmarci) for contributing the initial [i18n support](https://github.com/karimz1/imgcompress/issues/653) and the Hungarian translation.

- Added additional language files [@karimz1](https://github.com/karimz1).
  Some translations were created with the help of online translation tools, so they may not be perfect. If you notice anything incorrect or unnatural, contributions are welcome.

- Internals: Updated Frontend Dependencies to latest security patch.
